# Virtual_Workstations_Radar_Altimetry
This research project is a part of my IIT Kanpur's Summer Research Internship program conducted by SURGE for the year 2023 under the guidance of my mentor, Dr. Balaji Devaraju. In this project, I try to compute the intersection points between satellite ground track data and the Ganga and Yamuna river bodies in UP, India. These virtual stations are of significant importance in scientific analysis and interpretation related to Earth's topography and hydrological processes.
